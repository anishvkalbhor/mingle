# Mingle App - Clerk Authentication Integration

## üéâ Integration Status: COMPLETED

The Mingle dating app has been successfully integrated with Clerk authentication. All major components have been updated to use Clerk instead of the previous localStorage-based authentication system.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. **Clerk Dependencies & Setup**
- Installed `@clerk/nextjs` and `@clerk/themes`
- Added environment variables template in `.env.local`
- Wrapped app in `<ClerkProvider>` in `layout.tsx`
- Created middleware for route protection

### 2. **Authentication Pages**
- **Sign-in page**: `/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx` - New Clerk-based sign-in
- **Sign-up page**: `/src/app/sign-up/page.tsx` - New Clerk-based sign-up  
- **Legacy redirects**: `/signup` and `/login` now redirect to Clerk pages

### 3. **Protected Routes Updated**
- **Landing page** (`/src/app/page.tsx`): Uses Clerk auth state, shows different content for signed-in vs guest users
- **Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`): Protected with Clerk, loads user-specific data
- **Profile** (`/src/app/profile/page.tsx`): Protected with Clerk, displays user profile
- **Profile Setup** (`/src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx`): Protected route for onboarding
- **Profile Edit** (`/src/app/profile/edit/page.tsx`): Protected route for editing

### 4. **UI Components**
- Added `UserButton` component to headers for user account management
- Replaced manual login/logout with Clerk's `SignInButton` and `SignUpButton`
- Added loading states for Clerk authentication status

### 5. **Route Protection**
- **Middleware**: `middleware.ts` protects `/dashboard/*` and `/profile/*` routes
- Automatic redirects to `/sign-in` for unauthenticated users
- Proper handling of loading states

### 6. **Data Migration Approach**
- Updated localStorage keys to use Clerk user IDs (`user_${userId}_*`)
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition
- Ready for backend integration to replace localStorage

## üîß Next Steps Required

### 1. **Clerk Environment Setup**
You need to:
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your keys and update `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
```

### 2. **Backend Integration (Future)**
- Create MongoDB user collection with Clerk user IDs
- Build API endpoints for profile data
- Migrate from localStorage to database storage
- Implement user data synchronization

### 3. **Additional Features (Optional)**
- Configure Clerk appearance to match app theme
- Add social login providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Implement email verification workflows
- Add user management features

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Set up Clerk keys** in `.env.local`
2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Test the flow**:
   - Sign up as a new user
   - Complete profile setup
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - View profile page
   - Sign out and sign back in
